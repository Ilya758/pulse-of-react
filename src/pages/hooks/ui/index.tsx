        <Text>
          Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional
          components. They allow you to write cleaner, more reusable, and easier-to-understand React
          code by encapsulating stateful logic and side effects. Key built-in hooks include{' '}
          <code>useState</code> for managing local state and <code>useEffect</code> for handling
          side effects. Developers can also create custom Hooks to share logic between components.

          Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from
          function components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and allow you to use state and
          other React features without writing a class.

            Allows you to add state to functional components. You call it with the initial state,
            and it returns an array with the current state value and a function to update it. For
            example: <Code>const [count, setCount] = useState(0);</Code>

        <Text>
          Hooks have a few simple rules you need to follow to ensure they work correctly and to
          avoid bugs. These rules are enforced by the ESLint plugin for Hooks.

            </Title>
            <Text>
              Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use
              Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns. This ensures
              that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders, which allows
              React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple <Code>useState</Code>{' '}
              and <Code>useEffect</Code> calls.

            <Text mt="xs">

      <SectionBlock title="Pros of Using Hooks" initialSpaceAfterDivider="xs">
        <List spacing="xs" withPadding>
          <List.Item>
            <strong>Improved Readability & Simplicity:</strong> Hooks make components easier to read
            and understand by co-locating related logic, rather than scattering it across lifecycle
            methods in class components.
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item>
            <strong>Reusable Stateful Logic:</strong> Custom Hooks allow you to extract and reuse
            stateful logic across different components without changing your component hierarchy
            (avoiding issues like "wrapper hell").
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item>
            <strong>No `this` Keyword:</strong> Functional components with Hooks don't use the{' '}
            <code>this</code> keyword, which can be a source of confusion in JavaScript.
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item>
            <strong>Easier Testing:</strong> Logic within custom Hooks can be tested independently,
            making unit testing more straightforward.
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item>
            <strong>Better Composition:</strong> Hooks provide a more flexible way to compose
            behavior into components compared to patterns like higher-order components or render
            props in many scenarios.
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item>
            <strong>Smooth Transition from Classes:</strong> Hooks offer a way to use React features
            without classes, aligning with the functional programming paradigm.

      <SectionBlock title="Cons of Using Hooks" initialSpaceAfterDivider="xs">
        <List spacing="xs" withPadding>
          <List.Item>
            <strong>Learning Curve:</strong> Understanding the rules of Hooks and concepts like
            closures, dependency arrays for <code>useEffect</code>, <code>useCallback</code>, and{' '}
            <code>useMemo</code> can take time.
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item>
            <strong>Rules Must Be Followed:</strong> The "Rules of Hooks" (e.g., only call Hooks at
            the top level) are essential for them to work correctly and require discipline or
            linting tools.
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item>
            <strong>Dependency Array Pitfalls:</strong> Incorrectly managing the dependency array of{' '}
            <code>useEffect</code>, <code>useMemo</code>, and <code>useCallback</code> can lead to
            stale closures, infinite loops, or missed updates.
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item>
            <strong>Can Be Verbose for Simple Cases:</strong> While powerful, for very simple
            components, Hooks might introduce a bit more boilerplate compared to a plain functional
            component without state or side effects.
